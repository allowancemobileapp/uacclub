## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Vibrant blue (#2E86C1), evoking trust, stability, and divinity. Complements the 'Kingdom' concept and provides a strong foundation for the visual identity.
- Background color: Light blue (#D0E8F7), a desaturated shade of the primary color. This ensures a clean, calming backdrop that highlights content without distracting.
- Accent color: Warm orange (#E67E22), to signal action and energy. As an analogous hue, the orange is approximately 30 degrees away from blue.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif that blends modern aesthetics with a touch of warmth, suitable for both headlines and body text.
- Use child-friendly, uplifting icons to represent program categories, values, and actions. These icons should align with the color scheme and add a playful element to the UI.
- Emphasize clear, structured layouts with ample whitespace to ensure readability and engagement, promoting a sense of peace, focus and order on the page.
- Implement subtle animations and transitions to enhance user experience. These animations should be purposeful, adding delight and guidance without overwhelming the user.
